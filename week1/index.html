    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This week I learnt about the purpose  of challenges in this course  is to help me 
            deeply explore the programming concepts I will learn in the exploration phases. 
            A I study, it is important to practice the code examples to make sure I understand it.
             By doing this, I am developing fundamental knowledge and skills in technology.
            <li>Also, I need to actively participate in team meetings because it will help me when
                 I begin to work in a professional setting.
            </ul>

            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>While studying, I saw that students will request review to be evaluated, why? Why can't the instructor go ahead to evaluate?</li>
            <li>In some of the codes, console.log was used, are we allowed to use it in this course? In WDD 230, we were told not to use it.</li>
        </ul>
