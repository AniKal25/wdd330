    <h1>Week 7 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <main>
        <ul>
            <li> Functions have built-in properties such as length, but can have custom properties added.</li>
            <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain conditions.</li>
            <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>
            <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
            <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
        </ul> 

    <h2>Further Functions</h2>
    <p> In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around in 
        the same way as every other value. They can have their own properties and methods, as well as 
        accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by other functions. </p>

    <h3>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h3>
    <p> IIFE - (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, 
        is invoked as soon as it's defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the 
        end of the function definition</p>

       <p>(function(){</p>
       <p>const temp = 'World';</p>
       <p>console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);</p>
       <p>})();</p>
       <p><< 'Hello World'</p> 

    <h3>Init-Time Branching</h3>
    <p>This technique can be used with the feature detection to create functions that rewrite themselves</p>

    <h3>Callbacks</h3>
    <p>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming.</p>

    <h3>Promises</h3>
    <p>Promises don't do anything that can't already be achieved using callbacks, 
        but they help simplify the process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using multiple callbacks.</p>

    <h2>Ajax</h2>
    <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</p>

    <h3>JSON Responses</h3>
    <p>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. 
        The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</p>

    <p>fetch(url)</p>
    <p>.then( response => response.json() ); // transforms the JSON data into a JavaScript object</p>
    <p>.then( data => console.log(Object.entries(data)) )</p>
    <p>.catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))</p>
