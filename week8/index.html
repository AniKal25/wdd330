    <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <h2>Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <p>The transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</p>

    <h3>Translation</h3>
    <p>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative;</p>
    <p>transform: translate(45px, -45px);</p>
    <p>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:</p>

    <p>transform: translateX(45px);</p>

    <p>To move up along the y axis by 30px, include:</p>
    <p>transform: translateY(-30px);</p>

    <h3>Scaling</h3>
    <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.</p>

    <h3>Property</h3>
    <p>By using the transition-delay property, it's possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins.</p>

    <p>-webkit-transition-delay: 50ms;</p>
    <p>transition-delay: 50ms;</p>





    <h2>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <h3>Canvas</h3>
    <p>With HTML5's Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. 
        This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network.</p>

    <p>The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page:</p>
    <p>
        Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas.</p>

    <p>By using the "canvas tag", we will know if the browser supports it or not.</p>
    <p>When I used it for the example it was blank, meaning that my browser did not support it!</p>
    <p>Since drawing on the canvas is done using JavaScript, we'll need a way to grab the element from the DOM. We'll do so by giving our canvas an ID:</p>
    

    <h3>SVG</h3>
    <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe 
    vector graphics using XML. XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Like HTML, it's a markup metalanguage. 
    In plain English, it's a system meant to annotate text. </p>

    <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
    <p>The Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then 
    specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</p>
