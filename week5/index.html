    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it's best to find them early rather than later.</li>
            <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict". This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>
            <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.</li>            
            <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
             </ul> 
        
        <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <p>It is important to know that errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there. 
            Therefore, it is up to us as programmers to do everything possible to minimize errors occurring, and find ways 
            to identify and deal with them quickly.</p>

        <h3>Errors</h3>
        <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>

        <h3>Warnings</h3>
            <p>A warning can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.</p>

        <h3>Strict mode</h3>
        <p>ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.

            <p>function strictly(){</p> 
            <p>'use strict';</p>
            <p>// function code goes here</p>
            <p>}</p>
            </p>

        <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
        <p>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. 
            In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated, 
            so you will need to run through the program to see what's happening at different stages of its execution.</p>

        <h3>Debugging Tools</h3>
        <p>Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points. 
            You can then see the values of all the variables at those points and modify them. This can be very useful when trying to track down bugs. </p>
        <p>Here are the links to the debugger documentation for each of the major browsers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger" target="_blank">Firefox</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/microsoft-edge/legacy/developer/" target="_blank">Edge</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/" target="_blank">Chrome</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/Debugger/Debugger.html" target="_blank">Safari</a></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Errors Objects</h3>
        <p>const error = new Error();</p>
        <p> const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');</p>
        <p>const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');</p>


        <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
        <p>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors.</p>
        
        <h3>Try, catch, and finally</h3>
        <p>function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {</p>
        <p>'use strict';</p>
        <p>let answer;</p>
        <p>try {</p>
        <p>answer = String(squareRoot(number));</p>
        <p>} catch(error) {</p>
        <p>answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";</p>
        <p>} finally {</p>
        <p>return `+ or - ${answer}`;</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>}</p> 


        <h3>Tests</h3>
        <p>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will
             be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</p>
        <p>function itSquareRoots4() {</p>
        <p>return squareRoot(4) === 2;</p>
        <p>}</p>

        <h3>Test-driven Development</h3>
        <p>Test driven development is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is no code to test.</p>
        <p>The code is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work. These process is considered:</p>
             
        <ul>
            <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
            <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
            <li>Refactor the code</li>
            <li>Test refactored code</li>
            <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, 
            then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</p>
