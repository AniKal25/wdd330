    <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>
            <li>Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>
            <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.</li>
            <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>
            <li>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.</li>
            <li>Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.</li>
            </ul> 


        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page, and most of us use forms every day to log in to our favorite sites.
            Forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.
                 These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.

        <p>The default type of input field is "text", which is used for entering a short piece of text, such as a username. 
            In our example, we use a text input field to enter the name of the superhero.</p>

        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Object-oriented programming is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.
            An object is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program.
        </p>

        <h3>Constructor Functions</h3>
        <p>This is a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. Here is the dice example rewritten as a constructor function:<br>
        const Dice = function(sides=6){<br>
            this.sides = sides;<br>
            this.roll = function() {<br>
                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)<br>
            }<br>
        }<br>
        The keyword "this" is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.</p>





        <h2>Modern JavaScript Development</h2>
        <h3>Libraries</h3>
        <p>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks.
             JavaScript is an extremely flexible language that can accomplish most programming tasks- but not all undertakings are as easy to do as they should be.</p>
        
        <h3>jQuery</h3>
        <p>jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used today, as seen in these statistics on W3Techs and Built With.

        </p>

        <h3>ES6 Modules</h3>
        <p> All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.
        A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.
        The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined, rather than the global object.
        You can't use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn't very common in any JavaScript program these days).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Templates</h3>
        <p>Templates can be written in HTML or another language, such as markdown, which compiles into HTML. 
            They can be whole web pages, but are often just partials â€” parts of a page. This means that the application can update part of the page without having to make a request to the server, saving an HTTP request.
