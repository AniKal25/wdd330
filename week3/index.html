    <h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                 It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (a web browser), 
                 JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic 
                 control over them.</li>
            <li>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
                and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</li>
            <li>The best way we learn anything about JavaScript is by practice and exercise questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Object</h2>
        <p>An object is a self-contained set of related values and functions. They act as a collection of 
            named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions. 
            Another way to think about an object is that it's like a dictionary where you look up a property name and 
            see a value.</p>

        <h3>Object Literals</h3>
        <p>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties 
            and methods in curly braces {}. Here is an example of an object literal that describes the Man of Steel:</p>
            <p></p>const superman = {
                <p>name: 'Superman',</p>
                <p>'real name': 'Clark Kent',</p>
                <p>height: 75,</p>
                <p>weight: 235,</p>
                <p>hero: true,</p>
                <p>villain: false,</p>
                <p>allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],</p>
                <p>fly() {</p>
                    <p>return 'Up, up and away!';</p>
                    <p>}</p>
                    <p>};</p>

        <p>NB: To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces {}, and it is also possible 
            to create an object using a constructor function such as this example: </p>
            <p>const spiderman = new Object();</p>

        <h3>Accessing Properties</h3>
        <p>You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation like in the example below:</p>
        <p>superman.name</p>
        <p> 'Superman'</p>

        <h3>Calling Methods</h3>
        <p>To call an object's method you can also use dot or bracket notation. 
            Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name:</p>
        <p>superman.fly()</p>
        <p>'Up, up and away!'</p>


        <p>superman['fly']()</p>
        <p>'Up, up and away!'</p>

        <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction 
            with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, 
            and even altering how they are styled. It  represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.</p>
        <p><a href="heros.html">Example of a web page</a> Contains a heading and three paragraph elements.</p>

        <h3>Getting An Element By Its ID</h3>
        <p>The getElementById() returns a reference to the element  with a unique id attribute that is given as an argument. </p>
        <p>const h1 = document.getElementById('title');</p>
        <p>Every id attribute should be unique to just one element</p>

        <h3>Get Elements By Their Tag Name</h3>
        <p>The getElementsByTagName() will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag name that is provided as an argument. </p>
        <p>const listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');</p>

        <h3>Get Elements By Their Class Name</h3>
        <p>getElementsByClassName() will return a live node list of all elements that have the class name that is supplied as an argument.</p>
        <p>const heroes = document.getElementsByClassName('hero');</p>

        <h3>Query Selectors</h3>
        <p>The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find the first element 
            in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument.</p>
        <p>The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list of all 
            the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. </p>
        

        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p> Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. 
            Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, 
            pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.</p>

        <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
        <p>Event listeners in JavaScript are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens.
            and the program can then respond appropriately. For example:</p>

        <p>if (click) {</p>
        <p>doSomething();</p>
        <p>} else {</p>
        <p> // carry on with rest of the program</p>   
        <p>}</p>

        <p>The problem with this approach is that the above code would have to keep 
            returning to this if block to check if the click had happened.</p>

        <p>The following code can be used to attach an event listener to the document that fires when the user clicks anywhere on the page:</p>
        <p>document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);</p>
        <p>Event listeners are added to elements on the page and are part of the DOM</p>
